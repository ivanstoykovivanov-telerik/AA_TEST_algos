Beach
Today Steve is minding his own business at the beach. His coordinates are (sx; sy). All of a sudden he saw his friend, Ellen, swimming at coordinates (ex; ey). The y = 0 line separates the sand and the water. All points with y > 0 are on the sand and all points with y < 0 are in the water.

Of course, Steve wants to go talk with Ellen about kitties. It is very important he gets to her as quickly as possible. He can run with speed v1 on the sand and swim with speed v2 in the water. Find the minimal amount of time Steve will need to get to Ellen.

Hints for calculating time:

Let's say we have to move from point (0, 0) to (0, 6)
The distance between them is 6 units
If we are moving with speed 2 it would take us 6 / 2 = 3 units of time
Input
Input is read from the console
Three numbers are read from the first line
sx, sy, v1 separated by spaces
Three numbers are read from the second line
ex, ey, v2 separated by spaces
Output
Output should be printed on the console
Print the answer on a single line
use two decimal digits of precision
