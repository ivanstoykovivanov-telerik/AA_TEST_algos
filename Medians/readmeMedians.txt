Medians
Description
Write a program that supports three operations:

ADD number
Adds a number to a sequence
FIND
Finds the median of the sequence
EXIT
Stops the program
Median is defined as follows:

If the count of numbers in the sequence is odd:
The median is the middle number by value, not average
Example: the sequence 5 1 2 3 1 has median 2
If the count of numbers in the sequence is even:
The median is the average between the two middle values:
Example: the sequence 5 1 2 3 1 3 has median 2.5
