Gold fever
Description
Dim4ou is a famous BG rapper who was one day accidentally hit by a thunderbolt. From that day on Dim4ou started seeing everything in numbers, but not in black and green as Neo from the Matrix and instead in black and yellow (as Wiz Khalifa). What Dim4ou encountered is that these numbers are actually the price of gold ($$$).

As he knows the price of gold ounce for the next N days you need to help him maximize the potential profit. What you can do on each day is to either buy one ounce, sell any number of ounces that you already own, or not make any transaction at all. Your end goal is to calculate the maximum profit you and Dim4ou can obtain with an optimal trading strategy.
