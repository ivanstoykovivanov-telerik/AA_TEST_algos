Bridges
Steve is an experienced bus driver. Today he has to pass through N destinations (named from 1 to N). There will be M bridges connecting them. It will be possible to go from one destination to every other using the bridges.

The problem with buses and bridges is that they can weigh more than a bridge can sustain. So Steve can not use every bridge. Find the minimum number of bridges that need to be upgraded in order for Steve to be happy and to be able to go everywhere with his bus.

Input
Input is read from the console
The first line contains the numbers N and M
separated by a space
Each of the next lines contains three numbers separated by spaces
name of the first end of the bridge
name of the second end of the bridge
maximum sustainable weight by the bridge
The last line contains a number
the weight of Steve's bus
Output
Output should be printed on the console
Print the answer on a single line
Constraints
1 < N <= 1000
1 < M <= 100000
Weights will be integer numbers
1 <= each weight <= 200
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 32 MB
