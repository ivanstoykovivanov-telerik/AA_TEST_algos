Heights
Your task is to find the heights of a triangle. The triangle is given by 3 sets of coordinates in 2D space - the coordinates of each of the triangle's verteces.

Input
Input is read from the console
Input is consisted of 3 lines, each containing two numbers
x and y for each of the triangle's verteces
Output
Output should be printed on the console
Output is consisted of 3 lines
print each height on a separate line
use two decimal digits of precision
look at the sample tests for the order of the heights
Constraints
Coordinates will be in the range [-1000; 1000]
Coordinates will be integer numbers
