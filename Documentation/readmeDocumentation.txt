Documentation
Description
Coki is a developer who loves doing pranks. The newest one he wants to try is to transform the documentations which his colleagues write into palindromes (from Wikipedia: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward, such as madam or kayak.).

To do this he follows three rules:

He can increase/reduce the value of a letter, e.g. he can change d to e or change e to d (the border cases a to z and z to a are also allowed).
Capital letters are treated like non-capital letters, e.g. he can change A to b or change b to A.
Special characters such as " " (white space), ",", ".", "!", "?" are disregarded.
Each increase/reduction in the value of a letter is counted as a single operation. Your task is to help Coki find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given documentation text into a palindrome.

Input
Input is read from the console
On the single line in the console is the string to be converted.
Output
Output should be printed on the console
A single line denoting the number of minimum operations required to convert the string into a palindrome.
