MinMaxSum
Description
You are given a sequence of numbers and a number of groups G

You task is to find the MinMaxSum, that can be achieved, by splitting the sequence into exactly G subsequences.

MinMaxSum is the minimal possible sum of the sums of all such subsequences.

Input
Read from the standard Input

On the first line is a number N

The number of following subsequences
On the next 2*N lines find exactly N couples of lines

Each couple has:
On the first line of the couple are the numbers M and G, separated by a whitespace
M is the number of numbers in the sequence
G is the number of groups
On the second line of the couple are exactly M numbers, separated by a whitespace
