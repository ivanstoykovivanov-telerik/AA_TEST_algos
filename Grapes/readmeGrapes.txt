Description
Steve has reached a conclusion. He needs to eat more fruit. But what type of fruit does he like? He makes his own genetically modified grape which looked more like binary trees (see picture below).

His grapes are somewhat limited, so he calls them *rapes. N-rape fruit is genetically modified grape with N amount of *rapes.

Write a program which find the number of possible N-rape fruit configurations for a given value of N.

nput is read from the console
A number N is read from the first line
