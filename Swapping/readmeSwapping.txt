Swapping
Description
When you first learned to program, you were learned how to swap numbers. When Steve learned to program, he was able to swap a whole bunch of them.

When Steve raises his hands and says a number X all the numbers left and right of X swap their places.

Example:

[a b c] X [d e f]
will become:

[d e f] X [a b c]
You are given the sequence 1, 2, 3, ... N. Steve will say some numbers. Your task is to write a program that finds the sequence at the end.

Input
Input is read from the console
A number N is read from the first input line
Several space separated numbers are read from the second input line
those are the numbers which Steve says when raising hands
Output
Output should be printed on the console
Print the sequence at the end on a single line
separate numbers by spaces
