Sticks
Today Steve got angry and threw 3 sticks on the ground. Why? Ask him :)

What is interesting is that the sticks could form a triangle and if they did we would want to find its area.

Each stick is defined by 4 numbers:

x and y coordinates of one end ot the stick
x and y coordinates of the other end
Input
Input is read from the console
Three lines, each describing a stick by 4 space separated numbers
Output
Output should be printed on the console
Print the answer on a single line
use three decimal digits of precision
if there is no triangle print No triangle.
Constraints
Coordinates will ba integers in the range [-1000; 1000]
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 16 MB
