    Description
Steve owns a wooden board. He made his board special by writing several visible ASCII characters on it (codes from 33 to 126). The resulting string formed palindrome (it is read the same way backwards).

Unfortunately, one day he broke his wooden board in half and lost one part. Help him to repair his biggest achievement in life, by writing a program which finds the minimum number of characters that need to be appended right of the board to form a palindrome.
