Flies
Description
Steve hates flies. He wants to kill them all. Currently there are three flies in the same room as him. Each one has X and Y coordinates (Steve lives in 2D space).
This is the perfect opportunity for Steve to test his new weapon. His weapon can shoot 3 beams in 3 different directions from his position. His goal is to hit all 3 flies at the same time. In order to do that he has to stand at a position which is equally far from each fly. Write a program which finds that point.

NOTE: It is guaranteed that there will be exactly one point.


Input is read from the console
The first line contains X and Y coordinates of the first fly
Separated by a space
The second line contains the coordinates of the second fly
The third line contains the coordinates of the third fly
