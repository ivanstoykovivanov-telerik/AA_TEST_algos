Beers
Description
Coki loves numbers. He also loves beer.

His evil-genious twin Koci, deserted him in a desert. He also left some beers, so Coki can refresh himself.

You can think of the desert as a rectangular field with size NxM.

On any of the cells, there can be a stack of beers.
Coki can move to a next cell and only in 4 directions
Top, left, right and bottom
Each move of Coki takes him 1 time
Each stack of beers refreshes Coki with exactly 5 time
Coki always starts from the top-left corner and the exit is always on the bottom right corner
Help Coki to reach the exit as fast as possible!
